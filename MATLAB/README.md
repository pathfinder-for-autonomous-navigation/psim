Pathfinder for Autonomous Navigation

Space Systems Design Studio

Cornell University


## Overview

The main goal is to develop and test all Guidance Navigation and Control(GNC) algorithms needed to rendezvous and dock two CubeSats in low earth orbit. One satellite is the `leader` and just passively orbits. The other satellite is the `follower` and uses cold gas thrusters to rendezvous with the `leader`. Each satellite tries to point its docking face at the other satellite and point its antennas away from earth.

This doc is stored in the MATLAB directory of the psim repository which contains all MATLAB code in psim.

The MATLAB portion of psim has two major components.

1. A simulator to model the physics of Pathfinder for Autonomous Navigation(PAN).
1. A matlab prototype version of GNC related flight software.


The simulator has four main functions that preform computations with the `main_state`.
 * `initialize_main_state`: Constructs the main state given a seed, and situation.
 * `sensor_reading`: Outputs the sensor readings of one satellite.
 * `main_state_update`: Updates the main state over one delta time step (`const.dt` ns).
 * `actuator_command`: Modifies the state of one satellite, given its actuator commands.

The matlab prototype of gnc flight software has two main functions.
 * `initialize_computer_states`: Constructs both leader and follower computer states.
 * `update_FC_state`: Outputs actuator commands and updates one satellite's computer state given sensor readings.
These functions, and functions they call will have to be translated into c++.

There are two main scripts, `main.m` and `run_tests.m`. `run_tests.m` runs all the test scripts.
`main.m` runs a simulation and saves the `main_state_trajectory` as well as computer state trajectories.

## Python Integration

Python uses the [Matlab engine](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_external/call-matlab-functions-from-python.html)
to call simulation functions from MATLAB, primarily `config`, `generate_mex_code`, `initialize_main_state`, `sensor_reading`, `main_state_update`, and `actuator_command`.
Global variables in the workspace don't have to be used to transfer data.

Most Matlab types are compatible with python types: [Python to Matlab function inputs](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_external/pass-data-to-matlab-from-python.html)
[Matlab function outputs to Python](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_external/handle-data-returned-from-matlab-to-python.html)

## Directory Structure

 * `./*` - scripts to be called for/during the full simulation.
 * `./utl/*` - utility functions shared across all other MATLAB scripts in
   this repository.
 * `./environmental_models/*` - environmental functions shared across
   all other MATLAB scripts in this repository.
 * `./environmental_models/helper_functions/*` - helper functions for environmental functions.
 * `./test/*` - standalone scripts that test almost every function in the simulation.
 * `./plot/*` - functions to create plots of the `main_state_trajectory`

   * `gps_bias`,  (m and m/s)
   * `gps_time_till_lock`,
       time till the GPS gets a lock, starts at `const.GPS_LOCK_TIME`, then counts down and stays at 0
       when the antenna is pointing towards the GPS constellation (s)
   * `cdgps_bias`, (m and m/s)
   * `cdgps_time_till_lock`,
        time till the carrier-phase differential GPS(CDGPS) gets a lock, starts at `const.CDGPS_LOCK_TIME`, then counts down and stays at 0
        when the gps antenna is pointing towards the GPS constellation the piksi antenna is pointing at the other sattelite (s)

## get_truth
In addition to this core state, other info about the satellite is retrieved using
the function get_truth which takes a string and the dynamics of a satellite as input.

For example,
`get_truth('magnetic field body',main_state.follower.dynamics)`
returns the real magnetic field in the body frame.

`get_truth('magnetic field eci',main_state.follower.dynamics)`
returns the real magnetic field in the eci frame.

`get_truth('quat body eci',main_state.follower.dynamics)`
returns the quaternion that rotates vectors from eci to body

`get_truth('dcm body eci',main_state.follower.dynamics)`
returns the Direction Cosine Matrix(DCM) that rotates vectors from eci to body

`get_truth('rate body eci body',main_state.follower.dynamics)`
returns the angular rate of the transform from eci to body in the body frame.

Call `get_truth('help')` for complete documentation about supported values

## Functions

`config()`: sets up path and constants
`generate_mex_code()`: generates mex code from C++ wrapper function
`config()`: sets up path and constants
`get_truth(name,dynamics)`: returns named value from dynamics

The simulator has four main functions that preform computations with `main_state`.
 * `initialize_main_state`: Constructs the main state given a seed, and situation.
 * `sensor_reading`: Outputs the sensor readings of one satellite.
 * `main_state_update`: Updates the main state over one delta time step.
 * `actuator_command`: Modifies the state of one satellite, given its actuator commands.

The matlab prototype of gnc flight software has two main functions.
 * `initialize_computer_states`: Constructs both leader and follower computer states.
 * `update_FC_state`: Outputs actuator commands and updates one satellite's computer state given sensor readings.


main_state_update has a few main helper funtions.
 * `dynamics=dynamics_update(dynamics,actuators)`
        Update the orbital and attitude dynamics, and time using numerical integration.
 * `sensors=sensors_update(sensors,dynamics)`
        Update the sensor state given `dynamics`.

update_FC_state is also broken in to a few main helper functions.
 * `[orbit_controller_state, delta_v, delta_time]=get_next_maneuver(orbit_controller_state, current_orbit,target_orbit,current_time)`
        Calculate the next maneuver to rendevous with target_orbit.
 * `[orbit,jacobian] = orbit_propagator(orbit,current_time,delta_time)`
        Propagate orbit forward delta_time and calculate the jacobian of the translation.
 * `[orbit_estimator_state, both_orbits, time]=estimate_orbits(orbit_estimator_state,my_gps_readings,other_gps_readings,cdgps_readings)`
        Update estimates of my orbit and other orbit.
 * `[adcs_state,magrod_moment,wheel_torque,wheel_enable]=adcs_update(adcs_state,time,orbit,target_orbit,gyro,magnetometer,sat2sun)`
        Attitude Determination and Control System (ADCS) update.

Environmental functions.
 * `density= env_atmosphere_density(time,x)`
 * `[quat_ecef_eci,rate_ecef]= env_earth_attitude(time)`
 * `eclipse = env_eclipse(earth2sat,sat2sun)`
 * `[acceleration,potential,hessian]= env_gravity(time,x)`
 * `B= env_magnetic_field(time,x)`
 * `S= env_sun_vector(time)`

 Quaternion functions.
 * `u = utl_rotateframe(q,v)`
 * `qout = utl_quat_conj(q)`
 * `q = utl_dcm2quat(a)`
 * `qout = utl_quat_cross_mult(q1,q2)`
 * `q_triad = utl_triad(N_sun, N_mag, B_sun, B_mag)`

Testing utility functions:
 * `equal= utl_compare_main_states(main_state1,main_state2)`
 * `equal= utl_compare_dynamics(dynamics1,dynamics2)`
 * `equal= utl_compare_actuators(actuators1,actuators2)`
 * `equal= utl_compare_sensors(sensors1,sensors2)`
        returns true if sensors1 and sensors2 are close enough.
 * `orbit = true_orbit_propagator(orbit,current_time,delta_time)`
         returns the updated orbit, using drag, j8 and maybe other perturbations.

Plotting and visualization functions:
 * `plot_get_truth(main_state_trajectory,name,sat_name)`
        Create a plot over time of `name` truth value from `sat_name`.
        `name` must be an acceptable input to `get_truth()`,
        `sat_name` should be either `'follower'` or `'leader'`
        For example:

        `plot_get_truth(main_state_trajectory,'wheel rate leader (rad/s) body','leader')`

        plots the `'wheel rate'` of the `leader` and its norm in the `body` frame
 * `plot_almost_conserved_values(main_state_trajectory)`
        creates plots of angular momentums in eci and total energies,
        if these have a huge jump, there is a problem with physics.
 * `plot_pointing_errors(main_state_trajectory)`
        plots magnitude of error of where the sats are pointing vs where they should be pointing.
 * `plot_power(main_state_trajectory)`
        plots power stuff.
 * `plot_orbit_error(main_state_trajectory)`
        plots differences in leader and follower orbits.
 * `fancy_animation(main_state_trajectory)`
        creates a fancy animation from the simulation data.

## Functions to be implemented in C++
update_FC_state and any function it uses including:
    `get_next_maneuver`, `orbit_propagator`, `estimate_orbits`, `adcs_update`,
    `env_earth_attitude`, `env_eclipse`, `env_magnetic_field`, `env_sun_vector`, `utl_rotateframe`, `utl_quat_conj`,
    `utl_dcm2quat`, `utl_quat_cross_mult`, `utl_triad`.

The test scripts for these functions should also be translated into C++.
See the `/src` and `/include`
repositories.


## Test Harness
Each function will have its own test script in `./test/` called `test_functionName.m` containing:
    1. Setup of path, constants, and seed.
    2. Calls to the function.
    3. Asserts that the outputs are within required accuracy.
`run_tests.m` is a script that will run all of the test scripts and give a failure summary for each test that failed.

Tests should be completely deterministic, fast, and not have any prints or plots unless they fail.


## Team Member Responsibilities

Each team member is the principle programmer
for some functions in the system. If you are going to start work on a function,
create an issue with the same name as the function and assign yourself to it.
In addition to the function also write a test script that at a minimum just calls the function and add that script to `run_tests.m`
If you need new constants just add them to `config.m` and add the name, description, and units to the readme.


## Current Status

One the Matlab simulation side, next getting a complete version of `sensor_reading`, `actuator_command`, `initialize_main_state`, `sensors_update`, and `adcs_update` is the most important task. On the output and visualization side, `get_truth` is the most important task. On the C++ side, a working version of Kyle's vector library, and quaternion functions are next. On the rendezvous side, `true_orbit_propagator`, `orbit_propagator`, and `get_next_maneuver` are the most important.
