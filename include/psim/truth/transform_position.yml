    Reference frame independent interface for providing lazy transformations of
    a position vector in an implementation dependant frame to position vectors
    in the ECI and ECEF frames. This model is intended to operate on a per
    satellite basis.

args:
    - prefix
    - satellite
    - vector

adds:
    - name: "{prefix}.{satellite}.{vector}.ecef"
      type: Lazy Vector3

          Input position vector represented in the ECEF frame.
    - name: "{prefix}.{satellite}.{vector}.eci"
      type: Lazy Vector3

          Input position vector represented in the ECI frame.

    - name: "{prefix}.{satellite}.{vector}"

          Input position vector. The frame of this vector is specified by the
          implementation.
