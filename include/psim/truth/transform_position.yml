    Reference frame independent interface for providing lazy transformations of
    a position vector in an implementation dependant frame to position vectors
    in the ECI and ECEF frames.

args:
    - vector

adds:
    - name: "{vector}.ecef"
      type: Lazy Vector3
      comment: >
          Input position vector represented in the ECEF frame.
    - name: "{vector}.eci"
      type: Lazy Vector3
      comment: >
          Input position vector represented in the ECI frame.

gets:
    - name: "{vector}"
      type: Vector3

          Input position vector. The frame of this vector is specified by the
          implementation.
