    Reference frame independent interface for providing lazy transformations of
    a vector in an implementation dependant frame to a vector in the body, ECEF,
    and ECI frame. This is identical to the position transformer except it
    includes the body frame as well. This is primarily intended for transforming
    'directional' vectors into the body frame to act as sensor measurements.

args:
    - prefix
    - satellite
    - vector

adds:
    - name: "{prefix}.{satellite}.{vector}.body"
      type: Lazy Vector3

          Input vector represented in the body frame.

          Input vector represented in the ECEF frame.

          Input vector. The frame of this vector is specified by the
          implementation.
