    Reference frame independent interface for providing lazy transformations of
    a velocity vector in an implementation dependant frame to velocity vectors
    in the ECI and ECEF frames.

args:
    - satellite
    - vector
    - frame

adds:
    - name: "{vector}.ecef"
      type: Lazy Vector3
      comment: >
          Input velocity vector represented in the ECEF frame.
    - name: "{vector}.eci"
      type: Lazy Vector3
      comment: >
          Input velocity vector represented in the ECI frame.

gets:
    - name: "{vector}"
      type: Vector3
      comment: >
          Input velocity vector. The frame of this vector is specified by the
          implementation.

          The frame of the position vector needs to be explicitly specified here
          because we need the position of the frame we're transforming from.
          This implies this model is also dependant on a position transformer.
