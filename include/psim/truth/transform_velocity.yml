    Reference frame independent interface for providing lazy transformations of
    a velocity vector in an implementation dependant frame to velocity vectors
    in the ECI and ECEF frames.

args:
    - satellite
    - vector

adds:
    - name: "{vector}.ecef"
      type: Lazy Vector3

gets:
    - name: "{vector}"
      type: Vector3

          Input velocity vector. The frame of this vector is specified by the
          implementation.

          The position of the satellite is required in the ECEF frame in order
          to account for Earth's rotation. This implies dependance on the
          position transformer as well.
