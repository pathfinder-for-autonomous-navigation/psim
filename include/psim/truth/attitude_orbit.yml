    Generic interface for a six degree of freedom simulation. The presence of
    reaction wheels and magnetorquers is assumed. The coordinate system of the
    orbit propagation is implementation dependant.

    - prefix
    - satellite
    - frame

          Diagonal elements of the satellites moment of inertia matrix. We're
          assuming here that the off diagonal elements are small.

          Impulse applied to the satellite on a given timestep in units of
          kilogram meters per second squared. The coordinate system is
          implementation dependant. Note that this field is zeroed out on each
          simulation step to avoid applying a continuous input.
