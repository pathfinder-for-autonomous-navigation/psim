    Transforms the position and velocity of the follower spacecraft into the
    hill frame of the leader. Note the 'leader' and 'follower' are determined by
    the model arguments and don't refer to the 'leader' and 'follower' of the
    simulation. The 'frame' argument is the reference frame used to perform the
    calculation.

args:
    - prefix
    - leader
    - follower
    - frame

adds:
    - name: "{prefix}.{leader}.q.hill_{frame}"

          Position of the follower satellite in the hill frame of the leader.
          Units are in meters.
