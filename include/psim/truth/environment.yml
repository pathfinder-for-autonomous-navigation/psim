    Calculates environmental measurements seen by each spacecraft like the
    magnetic field reading and sun vector.

args:
    - prefix
    - satellite
    - frame

adds:
    - name: "{prefix}.{satellite}.environment.b"
      type: Lazy Vector3

        The magnetic field at the point of the spacecraft. The frame this is
        reported in is left up to the implementation.
    - name: "{prefix}.{satellite}.environment.s"

          The unit vector point from the spacecraft to the sun. The frame this
          is reported in is left up to the implementation.

gets:
    - name: "{prefix}.t.s"
      type: Real
    - name: "{prefix}.{satellite}.orbit.r.{frame}"
