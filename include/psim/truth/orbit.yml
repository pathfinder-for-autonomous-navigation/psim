    Generic interface for a point mass orbit propagator. The coordinate system
    the model operates in is implementation  dependant. This model should be
    used for simulations that don't rely on attitude dynamics.

args:
    - satellite
    - frame

          Mass of the satellite in units of kilograms.

          Cross sectional area of the satellite in meters squared. This value is
          used for the drag calculation.

          Impulse applied to the satellite on a given timestep in units of
          kilogram meters per second squared. The coordinate system is
          implementation dependant. Note that this field is zeroed out on each
          simulation step to avoid applying a continuous input.
