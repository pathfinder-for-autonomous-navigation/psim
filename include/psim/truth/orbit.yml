    Generic interface for a point mass orbit propagator. The coordinate system
    the model operates in is implementation  dependant. This model should be
    used for simulations that don't rely on attitude dynamics.

    - satellite
    - frame

          Projected area of the satellite along the direction of travel in
          meters squared. This value is used for the drag calculation.

          Impulse applied to the satellite on a given timestep in units of
          kilogram meters per second squared. The coordinate system is
          implementation dependant. Note that this field is zeroed out on each
          simulation step to avoid applying a continuous input.

          Satellite's orbital total energy. This is essentially the difference
          of the kinetic and potential energies.
