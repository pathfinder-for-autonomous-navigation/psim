    Interface for a model responsible for simulating the measurements seen by
    the CDGPS sensor during flight.

args:
    - satellite
    - other

params:
    - name: "sensors.{satellite}.cdgps.range"
      type: Real
      comment: >
          Range within the CDGPS can still provide readings of the other
          satellite's position.
    - name: "sensors.{satellite}.cdgps.dr.sigma"
      type: Vector3
      comment: >
          Standard deviation of the relative position reading from the CDGPS.

adds:
    - name: "sensors.{satellite}.cdgps.valid"
      type: Lazy Boolean
      comment: >
          Flag specifying whether or not the current CDGPS measurement is valid
          or not.
    - name: "sensors.{satellite}.cdgps.dr"
      type: Lazy Vector3
      comment: >
          Relative position this satellite to the other reported by the CDGPS in
          ECEF. This is set to NaNs if the measurement is invalid.
    - name: "sensors.{satellite}.cdgps.dr.error"
      type: Lazy Vector3
      comment: >
          Error in the relative position of the this satellite to the other
          satellite by the CDGPS in ECEF. This is set to NaNs if the measurement
          is invalid.
    - name: "sensors.{satellite}.cdgps.disabled"
      type: Initialized Writable Boolean
      comment: >
          When set to true, the CDGPS never produces a valid reading. This, for
          example, can be used to simulate a sensor failure.
    - name: "sensors.{satellite}.cdgps.model_range"
      type: Initialized Writable Boolean
      comment: >
          When set to true, a valid CDGPS reading can only be produced when the
          spacecraft are close enough.
