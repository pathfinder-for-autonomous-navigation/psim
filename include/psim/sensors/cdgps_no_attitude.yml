    Interface for a model responsible for simulating the measurements seen by
    the CDGPS sensor during flight.

args:
    - satellite
    - other

params:
    - name: "sensors.{satellite}.cdgps.model_range"
      type: Integer
      comment: >
          Flag toggling whether or not being out of range will prevent the CDGPS
          from producing a reading.
    - name: "sensors.{satellite}.cdgps.range"
      type: Real
      comment: >
          Range within the CDGPS can still provide readings of the other
          satellite's position.
    - name: "sensors.{satellite}.cdgps.dr.sigma"
      type: Vector3
      comment: >
          Standard deviation of the relative position reading from the CDGPS.

adds:
    - name: "sensors.{satellite}.cdgps.active"
      type: Lazy Integer
      comment: >
          Flag specifying whether or not the CDGPS sensor is currently active
          and producing readings.
    - name: "sensors.{satellite}.cdgps.dr"
      type: Lazy Vector3
      comment: >
          Relative position this satellite to the other reported by the CDGPS in
          ECEF.
    - name: "sensors.{satellite}.cdgps.dr.error"
      type: Lazy Vector3
      comment: >
          Error in the relative position of the this satellite to the other
          satellite by the CDGPS in ECEF.

gets:
    - name: "truth.{satellite}.orbit.r.ecef"
      type: Vector3
    - name: "truth.{other}.orbit.r.ecef"
      type: Vector3
