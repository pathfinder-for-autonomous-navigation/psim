    Interface for a model responsible for simulating the measurements reported
    by the gyroscope during flight.

args:
    - satellite

    - name: "sensors.{satellite}.gyroscope.w"
      type: Lazy Vector3
      comment: >
          Angular rate reported by the gyroscope in the body frame.

      type: Initialized Vector3

          Bias exhibited by the gyroscope readings in the body frame. This
          cannot be a lazy field as it needs to drift at each timestep and not
          just the ones where the field was accessed.
