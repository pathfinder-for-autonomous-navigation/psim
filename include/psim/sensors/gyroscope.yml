    Interface for a model responsible for simulating the measurements reported
    by the gyroscope during flight.

args:
    - satellite

params:
    - name: "sensors.{satellite}.gyroscope.w.sigma"
      type: Vector3
      comment: >
        Standard deviation of the angular rate reading from the gyroscope. This
        is white noise independent of the bias model.
    - name: "sensors.{satellite}.gyroscope.w.bias.sigma"
      type: Vector3
      comment: >
        Standard deviation of the noise integrated to simulate the gyroscope
        bias' random walk over time.

adds:
    - name: "sensors.{satellite}.gyroscope.valid"
      type: Lazy Boolean
      comment: >
          Flag specifying whether or not the current gyroscope measurement is
          valid or not. Note that this only applies to the actual angular rate
          reading and not the bias reading.
    - name: "sensors.{satellite}.gyroscope.w"
      type: Lazy Vector3
      comment: >
          Angular rate reported by the gyroscope in the body frame. This is set
          to NaNs if the measurement is invalid.
    - name: "sensors.{satellite}.gyroscope.w.bias"
      type: Initialized Vector3
      comment: >
          Bias exhibited by the gyroscope readings in the body frame. This
          cannot be a lazy field as it needs to drift at each timestep and not
          just the ones where the field was accessed.
    - name: "sensors.{satellite}.gyroscope.w.error"
      type: Lazy Vector3
      comment: >
          Error in the angular rate reported by the gyroscope in the body frame.
          This is set to NaNs if the measurement is invalid.
    - name: "sensors.{satellite}.gyroscope.disabled"
      type: Initialized Writable Boolean
      comment: >
          When set to true, the gyroscope never produces a valid reading. This,
          for example, can be used to simulate a sensor failure.
