    Interface for a model responsible for simulating the measurements reported
    by the gyroscope during flight.

args:
    - satellite

params:
    - name: "sensors.{satellite}.gyroscope.w.sigma"
      type: Vector3
      comment: >
        Standard deviation of the angular rate reading from the gyroscope. This
        is white noise independent of the bias model.
    - name: "sensors.{satellite}.gyroscope.w.bias.sigma"
      type: Vector3
      comment: >
        Standard deviation of the noise integrated to simulate the gyroscope
        bias' random walk over time.

          Angular rate reported by the gyroscope in the body frame.
    - name: "sensors.{satellite}.gyroscope.w.bias"
      type: Initialized Vector3

          Bias exhibited by the gyroscope readings in the body frame. This
          cannot be a lazy field as it needs to drift at each timestep and not
          just the ones where the field was accessed.
    - name: "sensors.{satellite}.gyroscope.w.error"
      type: Lazy Vector3
      comment: >
          Error in the angular rate reported by the gyroscope in the body frame.
