    Interface for a model responsible for simulating the measurements seen by
    the GPS sensor during flight.

args:
    - satellite

params:
    - name: "sensors.{satellite}.gps.r.sigma"
      type: Vector3
      comment: >
        Standard deviation of the position reading from the GPS.
    - name: "sensors.{satellite}.gps.v.sigma"
      type: Vector3
      comment: >
        Standard deviation of the velocity reading from the GPS.

adds:
    - name: "sensors.{satellite}.gps.valid"
      type: Lazy Boolean
      comment: >
          Flag specifying whether or not the current GPS measurement is valid or
          not.
    - name: "sensors.{satellite}.gps.r"
      type: Lazy Vector3
      comment: >
          Position reported by the GPS in ECEF. This is set to NaNs if the
          measurement is invalid.
    - name: "sensors.{satellite}.gps.r.error"
      type: Lazy Vector3
      comment: >
          Error in the position reported by the GPS in ECEF. This is set to NaNs
          if the measurement is invalid.

      type: Initialized Writable Boolean
      comment: >
          When set to true, the GPS never produces a valid reading. This, for
          example, can be used to simulate a sensor failure.
