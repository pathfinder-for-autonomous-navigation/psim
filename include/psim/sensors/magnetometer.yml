    Interface for a model responsible for simulating the measurements reported
    by the magnetometer during flight.

args:
    - satellite

params:
    - name: "sensors.{satellite}.magnetometer.b.sigma"
      type: Vector3
      comment: >
        Standard deviation of the magnetic field reading from the magnetometer.

adds:
    - name: "sensors.{satellite}.magnetometer.valid"
      type: Lazy Boolean
      comment: >
          Flag specifying whether or not the current magnetometer measurement is
          valid or not.
    - name: "sensors.{satellite}.magnetometer.b"
      type: Lazy Vector3
      comment: >
          Magnetic field reported by the magnetometer in the body frame. This is
          set to NaNs if the measurement is invalid.
    - name: "sensors.{satellite}.magnetometer.b.error"
      type: Lazy Vector3
      comment: >
          Error in the magnetic field reported by the magnetometer in the body
          frame. This is set to NaNs if the measurement is invalid.
    - name: "sensors.{satellite}.magnetometer.disabled"
      type: Initialized Writable Boolean
      comment: >
          When set to true, the magnetometer never produces a valid reading.
          This, for example, can be used to simulate a sensor failure.
