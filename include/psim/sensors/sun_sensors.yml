    Interface for a model responsible for simulating the measurements reported
    by the sun sensors during flight.

args:
    - satellite

params:
    - name: "sensors.{satellite}.sun_sensors.s.sigma"
      type: Vector2
      comment: >
          Noise in terms of a spherical coordinate representation of the sun
          vector. The noise affects the phi and theta angles in the body frame
          currently.

adds:
    - name: "sensors.{satellite}.sun_sensors.valid"
      type: Lazy Boolean
      comment: >
          Flag specifying whether or not the current sun vector measurement is
          valid or not.
    - name: "sensors.{satellite}.sun_sensors.s"
      type: Lazy Vector3
      comment: >
          Sun vector reported by the sun sensors in the body frame. This is set
          to NaNs if the measurement is invalid.
    - name: "sensors.{satellite}.sun_sensors.s.error"
      type: Lazy Vector3
      comment: >
          Error in the sun vector reported by the sun sensors. This is set to
          NaNs if the measurement is invalid. Note, that the error in being
          represented as the difference between two unit vectors and therefore
          has an extra degree of freedom.
    - name: "sensors.{satellite}.sun_sensors.disabled"
      type: Initialized Writable Boolean
      comment: >
          When set to true, the sun sensors never produce a valid reading. This,
          for example, can be used to simulate a sensor failure.
    - name: "sensors.{satellite}.sun_sensors.model_eclipse"
      type: Initialized Writable Boolean
      comment: >
          When set to true, sun sensor measurements are prevented in eclipse.
